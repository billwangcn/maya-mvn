Autodesk Maya 2012 - MVN Studio motion capture python plug-in
======================
LATEST VERSION 4.0

Autodesk Maya | Xsens MVN Studio - real-time motion capture plug-in.

This project was started as initiative by Joey Toppin and Rik Ruiten.

The goal was to create an opensource plug-in for Autodesk Maya to receive and process
motion capture data from Xsens's MVN Studio, real time.

The plug-in is written in Python.

We're about done with this project and we hope other people will continue it by freely adding their
needs to it.
