<h2>Message processing</h2>
<br>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
What do we mean by processing?<br>
With processing we mean the whole part of receiving a message, and converting the data string to readable floats for Maya to transform<br>
the given locators in the scene.<br><br>

The main thought behind the process is simple:<br>
Mvn Studio sends a message <b>==></b> the plug-in receives the message <b>==></b> the plug-in processes the message <b>==></b> the plug-in performs the transformations.<br><br>
All of the above, except for the transformation part, happen in a seperate thread.<br>
If the processing was to be executed in the Maya main thread it'd be terribly slow and Maya would not respond.<br>
But the transformations <b>MUST</b> be executed in the Maya main thread because that's where the locators are known.<br>
<br>
As soon as the end-user issues the 'start()' or the 'record()' command, the plug-in creates an object for every locator.<br>
This object can hold several values:<br>
<ul>
	<li>x translation</li>
	<li>y translation</li>
	<li>z translation</li>			    
	<li>x rotation</li>
	<li>y rotation</li>
	<li>z rotation</li>
	<li>ID</li>
</ul>

As of the current version of the plug-in the ID is not used.<br>
<br>
<h3> Further information </h3>
An full euler message from Mvn Studio is 668 bytes long.<br>
The message holds one header of 24 bytes long and 23 segment, every segment is 28 bytes long (24 + (23*28) = 668).<br><br>
 
The segments consist of a ID which is an integer (4 bytes), the X translation, the Y translation, the Z translation, the X rotation, the Y rotation and the Z rotation which all are<br>
single precision floating point numbers (4 bytes long or 32-bit).<br>
So bytes 1,2,3 and 4 of a segment is the ID. Bytes 5,6,7,8 of a segement is the X translation etc.<br><br>

We acces these numbers by issuing the received message like an array. For example: message[40] = floatingnumber1, message[41] = floatingnumber2, etc.<br>
This way we can take 4 floatingnumbers and pack them to a 32-bit floating point number or an int.<br>
<br><br>
We call the processing of a message a "round", and one round consists out of 23 "cycles".<br>
With the first cycle being the head. In every cycle the transformations for that body part are set in its class.<br>
Every body part is defined as an object, so we can say head.translatex = 5, head.translatey = 10, etc.<br>
After all cycles are done and every body part thus has its new values, the "round" is completed and all new transformations are performed in the<br>
Maya main thread.<br>

<br>
The receiving of the messages and the packing of each 4 bytes into an int or a 32-bit foating point number happens in a seperate thread.<br>
Only the actual transformation is executed in the Maya main thread.<br><br>
