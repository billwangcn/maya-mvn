<h3> State Machine </h3>
The code functions as a state machine as it operates in different states.<br>
We have thought of 3 states.<br>
<ul>
	<li>IDLE: the default state.</li>
	<li>READY_TO_READ: invoked after you've locked and brought your locators over to the program by issuing the 'lock()' command.</li>
	<li>READY_TO_STOP: invoked as soon as you're in a started or recording session.</li>
</ul>

The functions can only be issued when the program is in a certain state.<br>
This is to prevent errors, an end-user shouldn't be able to do 'record()' while there's no locators known in the program.<br>
And it's neat to write programs which act like a state machine, also for readability.<br>
<br>
Below a print of the state requirements of the functions and what they return:<br><br>
<b>Description:</b> 
<ul>
 <li>The lock() command can only be issued in the IDLE status, which is the default state.</li>
 <li>The unlock() command requires the READY_TO_READ status which is set by the lock() command to be performed.</li>
 <li>The start/record() commands require MVN streaming to the correct IP/PORT and the READY_TO_READ status.</li>
 <li>The stop command can only be performed in the READY_TO_STOP status and returns the READY_TO_READ status.</li>
</ul>
You can see that there are 3 levels of performance, and the 'undo' commands like unlock and stop bring you back to the level above.<br>
